Nowadays, in most engineering colleges, 
the big problem is that students are not ready for interviews. 

So, we made a Mock Interview Practice Program just for tech students, especially third-year and final-year.


We have Created "Fast-Track Mock Interview Practice Program"

IN THIS Program

1) We do one-to-one mock interviews (Technical Round + HR Round) with developers and industry expert.  

2) We hold live sessions to help you prepare for interviews and clear your doubts.  

3) We give you company interview questions with answers, including from big MNCs like TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Cognizant, and all.  

4) We provide you unlimited job leads on our website (technorki.com) for three months.  

5) We also guide you on career, latest tools and tech that companies want these days.
